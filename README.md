# My Neovim Configuration

My Nix-compatible Neovim configuration I made after seeing [redy'fs](https://github.com/redyf/Moon).

## Remark

This probably isn't how you should be using Neovim on Nix. My desire was to make a Neovim config that I could use anywhere, even outside of Nix. Thus, I had to compromise; managing plugins on Nix was not an option. If you know any cleaner way to do this, let me know!
