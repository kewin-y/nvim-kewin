# My Neovim Configuration

My Nix-compatible Neovim configuration I made after seeing [redyf's](https://github.com/redyf/Moon).

## Remark

This probably isn't how you should be using Neovim on Nix, but I wanted something portable that I could use anywhere (even w/o Nix). If you know a cleaner way of doing this, please lmk :)
